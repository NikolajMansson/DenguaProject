**Today's Progress**: Chose to participate in DrivenData's competition "DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread". Downloaded example  data from the competitions homepage. Opened, read,  and manipulated the data into new tables. Uploaded project to github.

**Thoughts:** First day working with python and machine learning. It was a strugle, but the book "Hans-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow" helped alot. Focus on previous examples and tutorials, and add new python knowledge where you need it for manipulation of data.
