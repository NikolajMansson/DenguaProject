**Today's Progress**: Chose to participate in DrivenData's competition "DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread". Downloaded example  data from the competitions homepage. Opened, read,  and manipulated the data into new tables. Uploaded project to github.

### Day 1: July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Created joint table for example in DengAI-competition, where you can check weather conditions against disease cases in city Iq through year 2010.

**Thoughts:** Struggled with creating a plotted graph in python that can make comparisions of the data in the joint table, will need to check further for litterature on the subject.

### Day 2: July 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Looked at tutorial on Django, and worked through a chapter about project management in "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow"

**Thoughts** I would like to put up a Django-homepage, showing some of the results from the study book. I need to understand the basic maths behind Machine Learning first though.  

## Day 3: July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started looking at lessons from Princeton on Linear Algebra, planning to finish during the week.

**Thoughts** I can read the chapters next to the mathematic videos, so I'll be able to see where its implemented.
